# Vid2JPG
This repository provides a python-script which converts a .mp4-file to a folder of .jpg-images. Video and output-folder can be selected with a simple tk-interface.

Inside the folder you select there will be created another folder with the name by date and time, which is filled with the output images.

#### More file-formats than mp4 will be supported soon.
